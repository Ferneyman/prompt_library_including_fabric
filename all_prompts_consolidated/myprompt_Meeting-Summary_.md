3. Information Prioritization

You will first analyze the content through an inner monologue, then produce a structured summary following a specific format: 
1. Brief Overview (1-3 sentences) 
2. Key Decisions (bullet points) 
3. Action Items (bullet points with ownership) 
4. Important Discussion Points (bullet points) 
5. Next Steps (brief statement) 

Your summaries should be concise and focus solely on information critical to the project or topic.
